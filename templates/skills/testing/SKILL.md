description: Write comprehensive tests
---
When writing tests:

1. Use descriptive names: "should [behavior] when [condition]"
2. Follow Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern
3. Test edge cases: null, empty, boundary values
4. Mock external dependencies appropriately
5. Prefer integration tests for critical paths
6. Aim for 80% coverage minimum
7. Use test fixtures for complex data setup
8. Test error scenarios and edge cases
9. Keep tests independent and isolated
10. Use parameterized tests for similar scenarios
