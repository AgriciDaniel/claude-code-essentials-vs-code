When writing or reviewing code:

1. Follow project style guide (check CLAUDE.md first)
2. Use meaningful variable names (no single letters except loops)
3. Keep functions under 50 lines
4. Add error handling for all external calls
5. Write self-documenting code
6. Avoid magic numbers (use named constants)
7. Use early returns to reduce nesting
8. Add JSDoc/docstrings for public APIs
9. Prefer composition over inheritance
10. Keep cyclomatic complexity low
