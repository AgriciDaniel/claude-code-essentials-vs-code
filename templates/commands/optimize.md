Optimize performance for: $ARGUMENTS

Analyze:
1. Time complexity of algorithms
2. Database query efficiency (N+1 problems, missing indexes)
3. Memory usage patterns
4. Bundle size impact (if frontend)
5. Render performance and re-renders
6. Caching opportunities
7. Unnecessary computations
8. Network request optimization

Provide before/after comparisons with benchmarks where possible.
Prioritize optimizations by impact vs effort.
